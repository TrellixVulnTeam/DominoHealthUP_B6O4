                            <h3>What is Diabetes Mellitus</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which patients have high blood sugar. It is a common condition and affects 8.6% of the population in Singapore. This is an increase from 4.7% in 1984. It is an important condition because there are many complications that can occur as a result of diabetes mellitus. These can be divided broadly into those that occur in the short term (the acute complications) and those that occur over a long time (the chronic complications).
                            <br><br>Before we go into details of these complications, there is one very important message that we must get across to you as patients and members of the public. These complications are preventable. Although this is not true in every case, well controlled diabetes mellitus through your own efforts and working with your doctor and other health workers, will at least delay the onset of these complications. Patients with diabetes mellitus can live healthy, active, rewarding lives.</p>

                            <p><b>Type 1 diabetes mellitus</b> has also been known as juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus or insulin dependant diabetes mellitus. This is the less common type and usually occurs in young persons below the age of 35. In this condition, the body is unable to produce insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas, a gland that is in the abdomen. Insulin is a hormone that controls the use of different fuels for energy. It is especially important because it allows the body to use glucose (simple sugar) instead of fats. When there is no insulin, the body cannot use or store the glucose that comes from food and this causes the blood sugars to become very high. Instead, the body uses fat as a source of fuel giving rise to some of the acute complications of diabetes mellitus.</p>
                            <p><b>Type 2 (adult-onset or non-insulin requiring) diabetes mellitus</b> is much more common and is the type of diabetes that affects most Singaporeans. In this type of diabetes, there is no shortage of insulin (at least at the start of the disease). Instead, the cells and tissues of the body are unable to respond to the insulin produced by the pancreas. They have "insulin resistance." (see cartoon below).</p>
                            <p><b>Gestational diabetes</b> occurs in pregnancy and significantly increases the risk of complications. The blood glucose levels have to be carefully controlled during pregnancy to avoid problems in both mother and child. Gestational diabetes also increases the woman’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>

                            <h3>Symtoms</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Frequent passing of urine.</li>
                                <li>Increased thirst.</li>
                                <li>Weight loss despite good appetite.</li>
                                <li>Hunger.</li>
                                <li>General weakness and fatigue.</li>
                                <li>Blurred vision.</li>
                                <li>Reduced feelings in hands or feet.</li>
                                <li>Itchy skin, especially in the genital areas.</li>
                                <li>Slow healing of cuts and wounds.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>If you have any of these symptoms, particularly if you are overweight, have high blood pressure or close family members with diabetes mellitus, you should see your doctor to ask him/her to test you for diabetes mellitus.</p>

                            <h3>Dignosis</h3>
                            <p>Diabetes is diagnosed via a blood test and not a urine test. If you have the above symptoms, it may be possible to make the diagnosis on 1 blood test. However, if the blood sugar is not very high, you may require 2 separate blood tests on different days. Sometimes an oral glucose tolerance test is required. For this test, you will be required to see your doctor in the morning after fasting for at least 8 hours. This means that you should not eat or drink anything except water the night before the test. You should have been eating a normal diet for 3 days prior to the blood test and not exercise heavily the day before the test. Your doctor will give you a very sweet drink containing glucose and will take blood from you after 1 and 2 hours to decide if you have diabetes mellitus.</p>

                        <h3>Diabetic Diet</h3>
                        <p>A diabetic diet is one which promotes a healthy balanced diet for all individuals rather than a diet for the sick. The total energy needs of the individual will be calculated at a level to achieve and/or maintain a desirable body weight. The proportion of energy from each of the major energy groups is such that 50-60% of energy should be derived from carbohydrate, 25-30% from fat and 15-20% from protein (The protein intake may need to be reduced in renal disease).
                        <br><br>Do not delay or skip your meals or snacks (if allowed) as this may lead to fluctuations of your blood sugar levels. If in doubt, you should seek medical nutrition therapy from a qualified dietitian who will help tailor a meal plan to suit your lifestyle and medical condition.</p>

                        <h3>Meal Planning for People with Diabetes</h3>
                        <p>The good news is, if you know how to choose your food wisely you may be able to control your diabetes with less or no medication at all. Meal planning is the cornerstone to good diabetes control.
                        <br>The aims of meal planning in diabetes are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To achieve as near normal a blood glucose level as possible to prevent and slow down the development of complications.</li>
                            <li>To achieve adequate nutrition.</li>
                            <li>To achieve a healthy weight which is important for good diabetes control.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>weight Management</h3>
                        <p>If you are overweight, you should try to lose some weight. Studies have shown that a 5% weight loss can very much improve diabetes control. A Body Mass Index (BMI) of between 18.5 to 23 is considered healthy.
                        <br>You can calculate your BMI using the following formula:
                        <br>Body Mass Index(BMI)= Weight (kg) / [Height (m) x Height (m)]</p>

                        <p>The tablets are not insulin . Insulin cannot be taken orally it would be destroyed by digestive enzymes.
                        <br><br>The tablets are effective only when the pancreas still produces some insulin. Therefore they are prescribed for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
                        <br><br>Medication currently available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus can be divided into 3 broad categories as shown in the table below</p>

                        <p>You may take more than one type of medication at the same time, once a day or as many as 3 times a day. It is important to take medication as prescribed by the doctor, not only when you think your blood glucose is high.
                        <br><br>If you are ill and unable to eat, you still need to take your tablets, because your sickness can raise your blood glucose. Eat your normal meals if you can. If you cannot eat your usual meals, take at least the carbohydrate in the form of fruit juices, soft drinks.
                        <br><br>Store your tablets at room temperature Do not use if they are passed the expiry date or if the tablets are discoloured.
                        <br><br>Take it at the same time each day. You may want to take your medication with the same time when you do a routine activity. e.g brushing teeth to help you to remember your medication. Always keep your medicines with you when travelling. Take enough for the trip, plus extras</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Test your blood glucose before and after exercise. It is not safe to exercise if your blood glucose is above 15 mmol/L, if you are feeling unwell or if there are ketones in your urine.</li>
                            <li>If blood glucose is low, eat a snack.</li>
                            <li>If blood glucose is normal, you do not need a snack unless you are doing some strenous exercise.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively, you can reduce your insulin dose before exercise. Consult your doctor or nurse educator on what is best for you.</li>
                            <li>Always carry quick sugar, such as glucose tablets candy etc. With you when you exercise (especially if you are on insulin). Hypoglycaemia (Low blood sugar) may occur during or after exercise due to increased transport of glucose into the muscles by insulin.</li>
                            <li>If possible, exercise with your spouse or a friend.</li>

                        <h3>Diabetes and Gum Disease</h3>
                        <p>Periodontal (gum) disease is often linked to the control of diabetes. People with inadequate blood sugar control appear to develop periodontal disease more often, more severe and lose more teeth than people with good control of their diabetes. This is due to the lowered resistance and longer healing process in people with diabetes. That makes good control of sugar levels, good oral care and regular dental checkup an important part of your diabetes management.</p>
                        <h3>Maintain Good Blood Sugar Control</h3>
                        <p>Good blood sugar control is unlikely to lead to development of gum (periodontal) diseases that may affect the lost of teeth.</p>
                        <h3>Oral Hygiene</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use a soft bristled toothbrush</li>
                            <li>Replace the toothbrush every 3 months</li>
                            <li>Brush at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste</li>
                            <li>Floss at least once a day or an interdental cleaner may help to remove decay-causing plague</li>
                            <li>If you wear dentures, remove them and clean them daily</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Dental Check-Up</h3>
                        <p>Have regular dental check up at least two times per year and also to treat any dental health problems early.</p>
                        <h3>What Information Do You Need to Inform Your Dentist?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You have diabetes mellitus and any other medical conditions</li>
                            <li>Your current treatment especially if you are on ‘blood-thining medications’ e.g. aspirin, warfarin etc</li>
                            <li>Your current blood sugar level</li>
                            <li>Names of any supplements that you are currently taking</li>

                        <h1>Sexual Dysfunction</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction is a condition that interferes with a person’s sexual performance. People with diabetes are more likely to experience sexual dysfunction than people without diabetes. <br><br>Sexual dysfunction in people with diabetes involves the blood vessels (diabetic angiopathy) and nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy) that may hinder sexual performance and enjoyment. This condition usually results from blood sugars that are not managed well. Other factors that may contribute to sexual dysfunction include psychological issues, obesity, depression, medications, smoking and other medical conditions.</p>
                        <h3>Sexual Dysfunction in Men</h3>
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction in men with diabetes includes erectile dysfunction (impotence) and ejaculation problems. This condition is due to nerve and artery damage in the genital area that may cause a disruption to the blood flow that is necessary for an erection.</p>
                        <h3>Sexual Dysfunction in Women</h3>
                        <p>Sexual dysfunction in women with diabetes may experience vaginal dryness. The women may experience some discomfort during sexual intercourse due to the lack of lubrication. Additional symptoms of sexual dysfunction may include: decreased vaginal sensitivity, difficulty climaxing and decreased sexual desire due to diabetes related nerve damage.</p>


                        <h3>What are the Concerns for Both Sexes?</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Blood sugar levels that are constantly high can lead to:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Reduction of testosterone levels. This may contribute to the decreased in sexual interest (libido).</li>
                                    <li>Abnormal nerve function (diabetic neuropathy) may lead to feeling of pain during sexual intercourse. This heightened the sense of pain that can make sexual relations uncomfortable.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Hypoglycemia</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hypoglycemia is a sign that people with diabetes need to look out for as sexual intercourse is a form of exercise.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Maintaining Sexual Health with Diabetes</h3>
                        <p>Diabetes Mellitus is a leading cause of sexual health issues in people with diabetes accompanied by other health conditions such as hypertension, high cholesterol and smoking. Men with poorly controlled diabetes are more likely to have sexual issues as compared to men who have good control of their diabetes. However, complications and sexual issues can be avoided by taking proper care of your diabetes, blood pressure, cholesterol and quit smoking. People with diabetes who experience sexual difficulties can lead an enjoyable and fulfilling sexual life by discussing it over with their doctor. It is advisable to seek early treatment to prevent the condition from becoming too severe to be successfully treated.</p>

                        <h1>Pregnancy</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <h3>Diabetes in Pregnancy</h3>
                        <p>There are three main types of diabetic pregnancies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A woman with type 1 (insulin dependent) diabetes who becomes pregnant.</li>
                            <li>A woman with type 2 (non-insulin dependent) diabetes who becomes pregnant.</li>
                            <li>A woman with gestational diabetes who is diagnosed with diabetes during her pregnancy. This form of diabetes usually ‘disappears’ upon delivery of the baby but there is a higher risk of it occurring in subsequent pregnancies or later in life.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A high blood glucose level left untreated has major consequences for the mother and the foetus. If present early in the pregnancy, the result may be physical abnormalities in the foetus. In the later part of the pregnancy, the growing foetus may have macrosomia (abnormal largeness) that can lead to too early a delivery, or damage to the baby or mother during delivery of the very large baby.</p>
                        <h3>Planning for a baby</h3>
                        <p>Whatever the type of diabetes, it is very important to achieve good diabetes control before you plan to have a baby. If you have diabetes and want to become pregnant, you need to check with your doctor or diabetic care team before you plan to conceive. If you are taking oral medication for diabetes, it is likely that your doctor will consider switching you to insulin and allowing your diabetes control to stabilise before you conceive.</p>
                        <h3>Treating Diabetes in Pregnancy</h3>
                        <table class="kheehing">

                        <h3>During the Pregnancy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Measure your blood glucose before meals, at bedtime, and 2 hours after eating according to your doctor or diabetes care team's instructions.</li>
                            <li>Control your diet. It may be helpful if you take frequent but small meals e.g. breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, mid-afternoon snack, dinner, and bedtime snack.</li>
                            <li>Inject your insulin as prescribed by your doctor.</li>
                            <li>Exercise regularly e.g. swimming or walking.</li>
                            <li>Learn to balance your meals, insulin and exercise.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>After the Pregnancy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you have type 1 diabetes, you will usually be able to return to the pre-pregnancy dosage very soon after delivery. The doctor will advise accordingly.</li>
                            <li>If you have type 2 diabetes and intend to breastfeed your baby, you may have to continue to be on insulin. The doctor may change the treatment back to oral medication after you stop breastfeeding.</li>
                            <li>If you have gestational diabetes, the doctor will advise on when and how to slowly stop your insulin should you no longer need it. You will need to be tested for glucose tolerance at 6 weeks after delivery. This will enable the doctors to confirm whether you have diabetes and give you appropriate advice.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Post-natal Visits</h3>
                        <p>Do not miss postnatal visits to your doctor. It is important, as he will advise you on your type of diabetes and how to manage it well. He will also discuss your future family plans as well as caring of yourself and your child.</p>
                        <h3>Breastfeeding</h3>
                        <p>You should be able to breastfeed if you are not taking oral medication for control of diabetes. However, you need to be careful with the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Cracked nipples and breast infections. Check with your doctor if you are not sure.</li>
                            <li>Very low blood glucose (hypoglycaemia). There is a need to increase the carbohydrate content in your diet. Consult your dietitian for help. You could also time your meals and snacks about half to one hour before you breastfeed.</li>
                            <li>Frequent high blood glucose (hyperglycaemia), due to poor control of diabetes, will result in high sugar content in the breast milk.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Your Baby</h3>
                        <p>Your baby’s blood glucose level is affected by your blood glucose level before delivery. This does not mean that your baby will have diabetes in later life. The doctor will observe your baby, who may be placed in a special-care unit so that his breathing and blood glucose can be monitored carefully. The insulin injections given during pregnancy to control your diabetes does not affect the health of your baby.</p>

                        <h1>Diabetes in Children</h1>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Most children and adolescents diagnosed with diabetes usually have type 1 or insulin dependent diabetes. They need insulin, dietary management and exercise to control their diabetes.</p>
                        <h3>Parent's Role</h3>
                        <p>If your child is diagnosed with diabetes, learn more about your child’s diabetes, and how to administer his/her insulin, how to plan his/her meals and exercise programmes. As your child grows, he/she must learn from you how to control his/her diabetes. In this way, your child will gradually assume responsibility in managing his/her diabetes.</p>
                        <h3>Psychological and Social Issues</h3>
                        <p>As your child goes to school, he/she interacts with other children and wants their approval and wants to fit in. Your child may consider diabetes a stigma. He/she may be unwilling to tell other children about it. A plan of treatment that interferes with school and friendships may be unwelcome. So you will have to consider these problems of psychological and social adjustment and help your child adopt a positive and healthy attitude towards his/her diabetes. Encourage early self-care in the sports and activities that he/she can carry out as well as the types of foods and drinks he/she can or cannot take.</p>
                        <h3>Hypoglycaemia</h3>
                        <p>When parents tighten the control of the level of glucose in the child’s blood, low blood glucose or hypoglycaemia becomes a real risk. Very active, young children are also prone to hypoglycaemia. It is important to make sure that there is good meal planning and regular monitoring. It is crucial that your child takes their meals on time and snack in between meals. Teach him/her to recognise the signs and symptoms of low blood glucose reaction and how to manage it.</p>
                        <h3>School</h3>
                        <p>The school should be told of your child’s diabetes. By understanding that your child has diabetes, special privileges may be allowed for your child to take meals and snacks on time, even during class. The school would also allow your child to go for appointments to the doctors as well as to use the restroom. A friendly schoolmate should also be taught how to recognise and treat low blood glucose reaction. As far as possible, allow your child to participate fully in all school and after school activities. Teach your child to have healthy and regular meals and stick to the medication schedule. If the activity your child participates in is hard and tiring he/she should take a small snack before starting on the activity.</p>
                        <h3>Growing up</h3>
                        <p>As your child enters adolescence, encourage him/her to assume more responsibility for his/her diabetes such as giving himself/herself insulin injections, making wise decisions on his/her diet as well as frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. Your child must also know the possible complications resulting from an unhealthy lifestyle. Therefore, he/she must learn not to smoke, take drugs or alcohol, which could increase the risk of complications from the diabetes.</p>

                            <hr>
                            <p>Hypertension is a fairly common problem in Singapore. Slightly less than 1 in 4 Singapore residents aged 30 to 69 years have hypertension. The older you are, the more likely you are to have hypertension. In the 60 - 69 years age group, more than 1 in 2 persons have hypertension.<br><br>Hypertension or high blood pressure refers to the condition in which the blood is pumped around the body at too high a pressure.<br><br>Blood Pressure (BP) is described by two numbers, for example, if your BP is 120/80, the systolic BP is 120mmHg and the diastolic BP is 80mmHg.<br><br>You have hypertension if your systolic BP is 140mmHg or more, or your diastolic BP is 90mmHg or more, or both (mmHg is millimetres of mercury , a measure of pressure).</p>
                            <h3>Causes and Risk Factors</h3>
                            <p>In 95% of cases, the cause of hypertension is unknown. In 5% of cases, hypertension may be due to causes such as kidney disease, narrowing of certain blood vessels or hormonal imbalance. Certain risk factors increase the chance of developing hypertension. These include obesity and diabetes.</p>
                            <h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
                            <p>Hypertension is often called the silent killer . This is because, even when severe, it may not give rise to any symptoms.<br><br>Occasionally, you may have headaches or giddiness when the hypertension is severe. However, these symptoms are not specific to hypertension; they are also present in other diseases.<br><br>Sometimes, hypertension is only discovered when complications set in, for example, a stroke or heart attack.</p>

                        <p>The randomised trials conducted to date have shown clear evidence of a lower incidence of major CVD events after high BP was treated with antihypertensive drugs. There is as yet no evidence that the main beneﬁt of treating hypertension is due to a particular drug properly rather than to lowering BP per se.<br><br>From the results of randomised controlled trials, it appears that each reduction of 10-14 mmHg in systolic BP and 5-6 mml-lg in diastolic BP confers about two-ﬁfths reduction in stroke, one-sixth reduction in coronary heart disease and. in Western populations. one-third reduction in major cardiovascular events.<br><br>There are no data which suggest that this effect of lowering BP is significantly different in Asian populations.<br><br>In patients with Grade 1 hypertension. monotherapy with most agents will produce reductions in systolic/diastolic BP of about 10/5 mmHg. In patients with higher grades of hypertension, it is possible to achieve sustained blood pressure reductions of 20110 mmHg or more, particularly if combination drug therapy is used.<br><br>The 1999 WHOIlSl-l guidelines’ estimates that the absolute effects of such blood pressure reductions on CVD risks (fatal plus nonfatal stroke or myocardial infarction) are shown in Table 7 below.</p>
