Introduction
============

This library packages `JSON`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`JSON`: http://www.json.org/js.html

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.json``) are published to some URL.


How to use?
===========


You can import ``json`` from ``js.json`` and ``need`` it where you want
these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.json import json
  >>> json.need()
